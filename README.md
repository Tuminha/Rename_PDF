<h1>PDF Renamer 📃🔖</h1>

As someone who works with thousands of scientific articles, I decided to create a solution for one of the most irritating issues I've faced: poorly named PDF files. So, I built this handy tool using Python and Streamlit!

What does it do? 🤔
This app renames your PDF files based on their metadata titles, making it easier to manage and locate them. The renamed PDFs are then packed into a zip file for easy download.

<h2>How to use it? 🚀</h2>
Upload your PDF files.
Click 'Rename PDFs'.
Download the zip file containing your renamed PDFs.
That's it! Simple, right?
